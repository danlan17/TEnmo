# TEnmo

# INTRODUCTIONS
This is a payment service app where registered users can make and request payments to other users (think Venmo). New users can register and start off
with 1000 TE bucks. They can then choose from a list of users to make payments or send new requests. At the pending request menu, users can see the 
details of pending transfers and accept/reject requests made to them. There is also a history menu showing details of the user's completed transactions.
